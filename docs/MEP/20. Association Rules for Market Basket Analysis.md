# Association Rules for Market Basket Analysis

## Association Rules
- imply x when Y is. This can be used on any set


## _Support_

### _Support_ of a Set of Items
- _Support_ is part of a transaction which holds a specific Set.
- measures how often something is bought together

### _Support_ of an Association Rule
- because we needs Rules -> _Support_ has to be adjusted

### Interpretation of _Support_
- rules with small _Support_
	- less interesting for economic reasons
- Values with good Connection between _Rule_ and _Support_ --> How interesting it is



## _Confidence_

### _Confidence_ of an Association Rule
confidence on how good a rule is

### Interpretation of _Confidence_ 
the same as a conditional probablility _p_(Y|X)
_Confidence_ checks how _good_ a rule is
--> trustworthiness ---> how many times it will predict true


## Apriori Algorithm
- generates rules that reach a threshold for _Support_ and _Confidence_
- executed in 2 steps
	- 1. _Frequent Item-Set Generation_

	- 2. _Rule Generation_
	- ![[Pasted image 20220202155217.png]]
- Parameters are minimum Support and Confidence
	- the higher --> the faster it is because of more pruning


## Reflecion
- _Support_ and _Confidence_ are rules for rating the products
- but there can be an inbalance
	- banana bought so much that its infrequent selled partner (example Anchocy Paste) because ignored and thus the score still very high is.
	- To correct that theres _Lift_


## Lift

### Lift of an Association Rule
- measure if rule is continous

### Interpetation of Lift
- upwards open
- advised to distribution and sort by lift
	- elbow method also a way
- lift = 1, statistically no connection
- lift < 1, shouldnt happen
- lift > 1, the bigger the better

_Lift_ = Association Strength


## Limitation of Aprior and Alternatives
- apriori
	- slow for large data
- Frequent Patter-Growth (FP-Growth) better for big data sets

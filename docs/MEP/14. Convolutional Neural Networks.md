# CNN
how NN process Images


## ImageNet Challenge
Public image collection with annotated pictures ---> Error-Rate used for classifcation.
Top 5 --> Error rate for 1 picture min identify 5 labels

## What an Image really is
- RGB
- 3 numbers


## Naive Approach
Pixels directly into a NN ---> too muhc data 
(240x240x3 would already be very high)

### Old times
Amount of features reduced via Feature Engineering ---> edge detection for example. Peformance only as good the filter chosen by the person.

### Invariance to Position, Scaling, Rotation
Postion, Scaling and Rotation shouldn't have impact on the classification

### MNIST
Datast for handwritting recogniztion


## Convolutions & Pooling
- used for classification
- Filter Matrices
	- Use filters to process multiple pixels
	- uses a lot of mathemtical functions
	- Sometimes an extra activation function is added
- Images and Filter have different Size
	- FIlter from left to ride
	- Offset of the movement is called _stride_
		- when bigger the image becomes smaller
	- do avoid shrinking of image --> padding
- Effect of Convolutions
	- Detect corners for exmaple
	- visualize attributes or hides them


### Convolutional Layers
- uses a lot of filters parallel
- when using filters the images shrinkes slightly
- example
	- use 8 filters, all 3x3 --> 3 x 3 x 8 = 28 weights
	- weights whcih the network has to learn
	- has a lot of input and outputs but not many weights

#### Convolutions as NN
Filter size = 3, because every layer has 3 inputs.
Conv1D(1,3) mean, this is a 1D convolutional layer with 1 filter and 3 filtersize. _Stride_ is also 1.
Filter reduces number of Parameter fÃ¼r next step, because the weights are the same



### Pooling
- Neighbouring pixels are usually similar---> same in convolution (high redundancy)
- when detecdint object we have to analyse an object from a dsitance
	- can't recognize a car from a few pixels
- Pooling takes out of a (example) 3 x 3 Surface the min, max and avg of the neighbouring pixel and uses those. 
- Size defined via _Pool-Size_ Parameter
- "zoom out" effect

### Pooling Layers
Pooling divide by Height and Width divided by Pool Size.
- example Pool Size 2

 ## Model Architectures

### Convolutions on RGB Images
- 3d filter merges color spaces
- Correlation to colors instead of color values (in 2d)
- 3d Filter contains 27 values = 3 x 3 x 3
- Filter over  the image
- Every covered point (27) will be multiplied with de filter and after added --> new value
- filter moved over the whole image --> new calcualtion
- Result is a 2D with values of the correlations

### Computer vision Disciplines
- not only what but also where
- Difficulty from top left to bottom right

# Anomaly or Outlier Detection
_unsupervised learning_

## Typer of Outliers
examples:
- TCP Traffic --> recognize hacked pcs
- Analyse MRI Pictures for cancer regocnization
- credit card recognition
- trading transactions...


### 3 types
- Global Outliers
	- Big difference to the rest (credicard patterns)
- Context related outliers
	- Depending on the context (25 degrees in the winter is sussy)
- Collective Outliers
	- A collection of datapoints which create as a gorup an anomaly (100 orders delayedd is sussy, 1 delayed is ok)


## Outlier Detection with ML
Outliers are difficult to find with Supervised Learning ---> are rare
Better with unsupervised learning


### statistical methods
standard deviation -->  helps know where 99.7% of the data hshould be.
if not in there ---> then outlier

### proximity-based methods
theres distance and density based methods
- distance based
	- can only find _global outliers_

#### Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Number says, if datapoint is outlier or not. When larger than 1 then _outlier_.
If smalelr than 1 then _inliner_

#### _k_-Distance
Distance / Radion which _k_Neighbours it includes

#### Recharchablitiy Distance
- maximum distance of 2 datapoint and the k-Distance of the 2nd point


### Clustering-Based Methods
start dataset without outliers, because clustering very influenced by outliers

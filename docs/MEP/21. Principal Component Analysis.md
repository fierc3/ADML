# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- dimension reduction for data analysis
- linear transformation with minimal informationloss
- used for visualization or _Data Quality Assessment_


## Projections to Base Vectors
- simple idea
	- delete an axis
	- possible with the rotation around the null point
	- prjojection made with the right angle to the axis

### The more Variance the more Information
- bigger the variance, the more information
	- alternative a small projection error is also good

### Data Redundancy
- _mean centered_ Features can be removed
	- null variance
- also when 2 features have _max Covariance_ --> redundant
- Projection hopefullly removes those redundancies


### Strategies for Dimensionality Reduction
1. Remove redundancy
	1. remove full redundant features
	2. combine features to remove covariance
2. Delete information (avoid this)
	1. Leads to information loss

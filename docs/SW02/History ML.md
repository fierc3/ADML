 # History Notes

#What-is-ML: learn without explicit porgramming

### AI WInter 1
We're very optimistic in the 70ties until no funding and knowling pure logic rules wouldnt be enough to make an AI human like.


### AI Winter 2

=> Resarch on Expert Systems seemed like the answer but was also disappointing




## Learning from new Data

#Bayesian-Networks
- big breakthru
- allow reasoning with uncertain knowledge and learning from experience

labelled data re more scarce but easier to process (duh)




## Current tech

tensorflow - google - js
pyTorch - c++
Keras - OpenSource 



## DeepLearning
#Deeplearning is processing  lot more data in comparison to ML. Automate cognitive tasks from large data (normally requiering a human)
20W

 ### Hardware

cheap										expensive
CPU => GPU => FPGA 	=> ASIC
slow											fast


#GPU most common. Has more cores than #CPU . Thus better for parallel tasks


### Cloud
Instead of buying hardware => "lend" process power by services
